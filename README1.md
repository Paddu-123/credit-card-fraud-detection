# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Objective:
The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions from a given credit card transaction dataset using machine learning models. The project demonstrates preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction to flag potentially fraudulent activities.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸš€ Steps to Run the Project:

1. Download the notebook from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
4. Load the dataset (replace the dataset path if needed).
5. Run all cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## ðŸ“Š Model:
The project uses models such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation is done using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ“Œ Notes:
